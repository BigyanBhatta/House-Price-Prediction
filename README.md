# End-to_End Machine Learning project for House Price detection.


## Primary Goal
1. To create a model which predicts the price of the house in lakhs based on the type of area, no. of bathroom, no. of balcony, area in sqft, and availability to move.

2. To understand the structure of end-to-end project development, that includes 
- setting up the entire project as a package by creating a setup file, 
- creating a requirement file that includes all the libraries needed for the project, 
- creating a custom exception and logging file,
-  model building, model training, creating data ingestion file for reading the data, 
- data transformation file for feature engineering, 
- model training file specifically for model building and hyper-parameter tuning and creating the prediction pipeline and
- finally, creating an application using Flask for model deployment.
